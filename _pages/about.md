I live in Sydney and am completing a PhD in physics at the University of Sydney advised by [Stephen Bartlett](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=eL6YI1wAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to this I worked at [Q-CTRL](https://q-ctrl.com) as a quantum control engineer. I grew up in Germany and previously studied physics, computer science and mechatronic & space engineering at USyd.



Research Interests
======
I am a theorist working on quantum computing. 

Currently I am primarily working on the following topics
* quantum error correction and fault-tolerant architecture design
* noise-protected superconducting qubits
