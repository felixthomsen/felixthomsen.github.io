I live in Sydney and am completing a PhD in physics at the University of Sydney advised by [Stephen Bartlett](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=eL6YI1wAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Andrew Doherty](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=F3fXFXwAAAAJ&hl=en). I grew up in Germany and previously studied physics, computer science and engineering at USyd and UPenn.



Research Interests
======
I am a theorist working on quantum computing. 

Currently, I am primarily working on the following topics
* quantum error correction and fault-tolerance
* noise-protected superconducting qubits
